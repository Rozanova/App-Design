_&quot;You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.&quot;_

_~Maya Angelou_



_&quot;Even design centers are exposed to the complicity of the media, running the risk of failing to reach their original objective: to make a difference between design as intelligent problem solving and styling. After all, it is a question of a renaissance of the tradition of the Good Design Movement... The advocates of Good Design pursued socio-pedagogical objectives, while the life style centers of today pursue exclusively commercial and marketing aims to provide orientation for consumption patterns… &quot;_

_~Gui Bonsiepe. Design and Democracy._



_&quot;I tell my students, 'When you get these jobs that you have been so brilliantly trained for, just remember that your real job is that if you are free, you need to free somebody else. If you have some power, then your job is to empower somebody else. This is not just a grab-bag candy game.”&quot;_

_~Toni Morrison_


### Course Description
In this course students will  design user experiences (UX) for native applications for mobile devices while considering and evaluating what types of digital products can and should be put out into the world as tools for the day-to-day, as speculative art projects, or as forms of resistance to existing sociotechnical systems that move us today. 


### Objectives

- Students will conduct research (Human-Centered Design methodologies) including interviews, surveys, secondary research, competitive analysis, and usability testing in order to produce an informed and useful app. 

- Students will apply standard usability heuristics to their designs and demonstrate knowledge of these heuristics through giving feedback to other students on the usability heuristic of their designs. 

- Students will learn about Human-Centered Design and it's critique, Speculative and Critical Design, Design for Social Innovation, and Ludic Design. They will be encouraged to design critically whether for an experimental artifact or for a practical one intended for day-to-day use.

- Students will familiarize themselves with design for accessibility and include this knowledge into their designs.

- Students will build their apps from the ground up, starting from low fidelity hand-drawn prototypes and ending in a high fidelity digital prototype. 

- Students will use rapid prototyping techniques (iterative design) in order to validate their assumptions, gain insight, and steer their designs towards improvement. 

- Students will familiarize themselves with native UI elements in Apple and Android platforms, explore platform-agnostic UI, and design for one of the platforms of their choice.

- Students will practice presenting and defending their design decisions.

- Students will critique the work of other students and ask constructive questions that will encourage critical thinking about app features and design decisions. 

- Students will also get a chance to discuss creative career paths. 



### Things to bring to class:
:notebook: notebook & :pencil: pencil or :pen: pen



### Tools we will use:
[Figma](https://www.figma.com), text editing software of choice, are.na or pinterest or other tool for creating mood boards, pencils, paper.



### Projects:
Students will design an app that will fit in one of the following categories: 
1. App as civic engagement tool. Civic Tech.
2. Speculative app a design/art project to address potential future societal needs.
3. Critical app design as design/art project that critiques existing social and cultural systems.
4. Ludic design - splayful and gaeful design.
5. Design for social innocation and sustainability - a way to connect people in mutually benefitial ways.  
6. Student's choice, as long as it follows a loose rubrick discussed in class. Can speak with me if you would like to make an artistic app or something out of the ordinary and we can work out the criteria for grading it.

   Students are welcome to create combination works -  for axample, an app that goes along with a childrens' book, or an app that is installed in a deice. For example, a student in the past created a UI for a recycling juke box they invented, so they prototyped a jukebox mock-up and designed an interface for the jukebox in Figma. 


### Readings:

[How to think differently about doing good as a creative person by Omayeli Arenyeka ] (https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-think-differently-about-doing-good-as-a-creative-person/)
[How to think differently about doing good as a creative person by Don Norman]
(https://ia902800.us.archive.org/3/items/thedesignofeverydaythingsbydonnorman/The%20Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20by%20Don%20Norman.pdf)

Optional: 

[How Things Don't Work by Victor Papanek](https://papanek.org/how-things-dont-work-the-dreamscape-of-victor-papanek/)
[Design and Democracy by BGui Bonsiepe](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/desi.2006.22.2.27)

### Assessment and grading
A rubric will be handed out for the final project presentation. 

Where applicable, all projects will be evaluated according to the following criteria
in equal weight:

#### Research and ideation: 
Whether and how much thought and investigation have been given toward a particular project in order to arrive at a clear and strong concept.

#### Overall design and concept: 
Formal design quality and how well the piece meets the strategic goals of the project.

#### Organization of content: 
Expression of visual hierarchy, clarity of communication.

#### Execution and craft: 
How well the work meets professional standards, in terms of quality of resolution of images, spelling, and placement of correct native UI elements in the layout. 

The degree of improvement in the quality of a student’s work over the course of the
semester may also be considered in the evaluation of a final grade.
Your final grade will be assessed according to the percentages below:
* Homework assignment completion.............50%
* Quality of work: ..........................15%
* Attendance: ...............................10%
* Participation: ............................10%
* Final: ....................................15%


### General Policies including lateness/absence
Students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to work for the entire class
period. Although in-class work sessions are an integral component of this course, outside
work on assignments will be required to meet project deadlines. Significant progress
between classes is expected. Projects are due at the beginning of each class.

Candidates are expected to attend every class session of each course in which they are
enrolled and to be on time. A candidate cannot receive credit for a course if absent more
than two times. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. An
instructor may treat lateness as equivalent to absence. Per CCNY policy, an instructor has
the right to drop a candidate from a course for excessive absences. The Registrar will enter
a grade of WU.

Students who are absent are expected to find out from other students about what they
missed in class as well as any assignments due, and make up the work.
Students who are marked as Absent for more than two classes will have their final grades
reduced by one full letter grade for each additional time they are marked Absent. For
example, and A student who is marked as Absent three times will receive a final grade of B,
one who is marked as Absent four times will receive a final grade of C, and so on.
Students who are more than ten minutes late to class will be marked as Late. Students who
are marked as Late five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction to their final
grades. (For example, a student who would have been given an A as a final grade who is
marked as Late five times will be given a final grade of A-). Students who are marked as Late
more than five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction for each additional
time they are marked as Late. (For example, that same student would be given a B+ if she
were marked as Late six times, and a B if she were marked as Late seven times). Students
who are marked as Late eight or more times will receive a grade of F for the course.
A break will be designated in each class. Students are asked to refrain from leaving the
classroom at any time other than that designated for the class break, except in cases
of emergency. Students who fail to adhere to this policy repeatedly will be subject to a
reduction in final grade. Students who are more than ten minutes late returning from break
will be marked as Late for the entire class.

Late assignments will be given a one-quarter letter grade reduction for each class they are
late. Missing assignments will be given a grade of F.

Consideration will not be given for failure to produce work due to loss of data. Please back
up your work.

This is a hands-on course, and regular attendance is necessary for participation. You will be graded on in-class participation. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. Students who miss numerous classes will find it difficult to pass the course. Visual assignments and projects will be graded based on: one for technical merit, concept and your demonstrated ability to understand the material. 

For the most up-to-date information (including what is due next class) visit the class’s Slack channel (to which you have been invited).

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty is prohibited in Queens College of New York. Penalties for academic
dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or
disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. Cheating is the unauthorized use or
attempted use of material, information, notes, study aids, devices or communication during
an academic exercise. Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research
or writings as your own. More information is available at http://sps.cuny.edu/acad_policies/

2. Readings
Design of Everyday Things - Chapter One (p1-p36, Don Norman)

https://ia902800.us.archive.org/3/items/thedesignofeverydaythingsbydonnorman/The%20Design%20of%20Everyday%20Things%20by%20Don%20Norman.pdf

10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design (NNG)
https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/ 

Choose “UX Hall of Fame” and  “UX Hall of Shame” entries and submit to GC (see example attached, also in slides)

 UX Hall of Fame entry: Choose a product/service that you feel has a good user experience. Write two to three paragraphs to describe what about it makes it a good user experience. Include supporting images.

UX Hall of Shame entry: Choose any product/service that you feel has a bad user experience. Write two to three paragraphs to describe what makes it a bad user experience. Include supporting images.

Please cite ideas from the readings in your submission


#### Week 2 
##### In-class: 
* Students share mind maps and app ideas. Every students gets feedback from the class and rhe instructor. 

##### HW: 

1. Choose one app idea. Finalize it.


2. Start a mood board for your app idea. Try are.na for that. At least ten images.



3. Start secondary research. Read about it here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/154CIQRXOOmjGaS7kpeQmMyHf723VifvycWLa_VG5aS0/edit?usp=sharing








#### Week 3 
##### In-class: 


1. Interviews for your idea: Come up with questions for both regular participant [*interviews*](https://www.designkit.org/methods/2) and [*expert interviews*](https://www.designkit.org/methods/43).
Blog it and post link to [Weekly Assignments document]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNxX5W69mKBNEXMsRS5N9qab15BsAwzGitfKVnQnIKg/edit?usp=sharing) 
2. Frame the design challenge. In other words, come up with a [“How might we” statement](https://www.designkit.org/methods/60). Blog it and post link to [Weekly Assignments document]
(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YNxX5W69mKBNEXMsRS5N9qab15BsAwzGitfKVnQnIKg/edit?usp=sharing) 
 


#### HW:


*Post your tweaked interview questions. Post it to GC.   We will spend a few more rounds interviewing each other tomorrow then synthesize the results to help us come up with features. If you can interview friends and family today and tonight - even better but not required. The more insights  you get the better. Interviewing 5 people is a good amount. 

*Turn them into a survey and send to as many pals and family and ask them to fill out by tomorrow so that you can look at and work with the results over the weekend. Post the survey to GC. 
Also don't feel like you guys have to stop at interviews/survey and, secondary research, and There are lots of research methods here: https://www.designkit.org/ (the ones in red are the inspiration phase ones!). For example, i really love this analogous systems one: https://www.designkit.org/methods/analogous-inspiration. So if you are looking to amplify the delight of ice cream, you may learn a lot from interviewing pizza lovers who have similar feelings and rituals around food and sharing. 













#### Week 4
##### In-class: 
*Lecture on fidnig insifhts and opportunities, user journeys, and accessibility. 
##### In-class activity: 
*Read the survey/interview results. Look for patterns. If you have too much data use the affinity mapping technique mentioned in the class notes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_vLIaUYHSo. Write out some insights, opportunities, and features based on patterns you notice. 
*Prioritize your features .
*Make a competitive analysis of your app’s features compared to other apps’ features.
*User journey (aka journey map) . Lst our the steps the user takes as they discover and use your app to improve their experience in a given area of life. Could just list the steps or try this template in figma.
*Turn the user journey into a storyboard. Sketch by hand or you can use storyboardthat.com. 
Make a primary user flow (for the main feature of your app).  https://app.diagrams.net/  or try a user flow template then make 2 secondary user flows.

*Review Accessibility innovation. Choose a disability to focus on (Vision, hearing, neurodiversity, Learning, Mobility, Mental Health) and click into that section to get ideas on what kinds of accessibility features have been implemented to date in digital products. Feel free to use other credible sources you find as well on the internet.Then come up with a feature that makes your app accessible. Write a sentence or more about it and submit to GC.


##### HW:  

.
(This may take 15 min but if you have a lot of data could take 1 hr)
Write out your insights and solutions, list out and prioritize features.

For those of you who have a lot of data (or will get a lot of data
later) and want to try affinity mapping over the weekend you can try
this method:

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/affinity-diagram/


2. (10 min) Competitive analysis - compare features.

3.
(5 min) Make a journey map with touch points that show how the user (at
least one of them if you have more than one) goes about using your app.
This shows their starting point and the end point where the app has
improved their experience. 

4. (10 - 20 min) Make a
storyboard of the user journey (steps the user takes before, during, and
after they encounter your app that detail how their experience is
improved by your app)


5. (7 -10 min) Make a primary user flow  - a schema that shows how the main feature of your app is used from start to finish (for the main feature of your app). 

Use https://app.diagrams.net/. 
or

https://www.figma.com/community/search?resource_type=mixed&sort_by=relevancy&query=user+flow+diagram&editor_type=all&price=free&creators=all
 
 (7 - 10 min) Then make 2 secondary user flows. These will show how the user will use two other features of your app from start to finish.


6. Review https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/accessible-technology-products?rtc=1 .
Choose a disability to focus on (Vision, hearing, neurodiversity,
Learning, Mobility, Mental Health) and click into that section to get
ideas on what kinds of accessibility features have been implemented to
date in digital products. Feel free to use other credible sources you
find as well on the internet.

Then come up with a feature that makes your app accessible in at least one way. Write a sentence or more about it and feel free to sketch it out.

If you chose dark/light mode, for example, explain how it will differ from the
default light/dark mode that comes with your device. Same goes for the
rest of the features. If you have a specialized screen reader, how will
it be unique to your app? Perhaps your feature is something that native
apps don't have by default! For example, Spotify (and some other apps)
have special driving mode feature that is not found in the native
accessibility settings of the phone. 


#### Week 5 
##### In-class: 

* Class Critique: Students Present competitive analysis and features. 
* Lecture: Prototyping and usability techniques. (Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD)

* Lecture: Native UI part 1
* Product walkthrough, UI Patterns.
*
*   In-class activity: User flows.

##### HW: 
Paper wireframes
Hand-drawn ideally.

Wireframing: Turning your user flows into screen flows
Some guidelines:


1. Four features must be shown: Primary, two secondary, and one accessibility.

Each wireframe flow (aka screen flows aka page flows) has at least one feature. So you will likely have 4 of these wireframe flows. 


2. Must be sequential left-to-right way wireframe flows, based on your user flows. See attached example. Numbering the screens or adding arrows can help.


3.  Hand drawn in paper, then you can snap a photo and upload here. Next clas we will upload them  to our Figjam whiteboard
OR  
you can draw using some digital drawing software (if you like to use that already, say, Procreate or Freehand) and screen grab those drawings.

4. Must be greyscale.Too early for color.

5 Placeholder

Too early for real images or other media.
Use placeholder boxes with X in them to indicate photos or other images.

For video you can have a rectangle with a triangle play button, for example.Can label these placeholder containers with 'illustration of __' or 'photo of__' 'video _ of'


6 . Must  have real titles and navigation labels. The only thing that can be in lorem ipsum (dummy text) is the body copy (the paragraph content text). 


Tip: It's ok to use a color if necessary, for example for callous, but it should not be used for UI in these grayscale prototypes. (see the example attached)


Have fun and good luck!

#### Week 6 
##### In-class: 
* Lecture: Prototyping and usability techniques. (Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD)
* In-class activity: Use Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD to prototype the next iteration of the wireframes for testing.
* Lecture:Onboarding flows, sign-in, blank slate patterns.



##### HW: 
Finish Figma wireframes for your primary and two secondary features and your accessibility feature. 

That usually means 4 wire flow starting points if there is one feature per wire flow. However, if you have features that are consecutively used it is best to put them into one wire flow.


#### Week 7
##### In-class:  

Usability testing 

##### HW:  

*Update low-fi wireframes for all 4 flows
Show the before and after screenshots and explain what you changed and why (should talk about usability session feedback). 
*Then, I’d like you to try the parallel design approach: This entails making three versions of the flow for your main feature. What other ways can a user get to the desired result?

*Finish/Update your scenarios and tasks 

Focus on 3 straightforward, actionable tasks that have well-defined end states. Plus accessibility.

For example

Scenario: You are at home watching a movie on Sunday evening. You are feeling hungry and decide to order a pizza for dinner. 

Task: Using this mobile phone, access our app and order a large pizza with thick crust, pepperoni, olives, and extra cheese and have it delivered to your address. 






#### Week 8 
##### In-class: 

* In-class lecture: Native UI part 2
* In-class lecture: parallel design
* In-class workshop: Choose 1 out of your three versions of the primary flow. Make the appropriate edits to that flow based on class feedback. These are still greyscale and low res. Show before and after screenshots of the changes and, in addition, explain what you changed in words (should talk about usability session feedback).

If you haven't finished the lo-res secondary flows from last week,  do so and post them to last week's assignment. you will test them in class next week.
