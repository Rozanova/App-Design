_&quot;You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have.&quot;_

_~Maya Angelou_



_&quot;Even design centers are exposed to the complicity of the media, running the risk of failing to reach their original objective: to make a difference between design as intelligent problem solving and styling. After all, it is a question of a renaissance of the tradition of the Good Design Movement... The advocates of Good Design pursued socio-pedagogical objectives, while the life style centers of today pursue exclusively commercial and marketing aims to provide orientation for consumption patterns… &quot;_

_~Gui Bonsiepe. Design and Democracy._





### Course Description
In this course students will  design user experiences (UX) for native applications for mobile devices while considering and evaluating what types of digital products can and should be put out into the world as tools for the day-to-day, as speculative art projects, or as forms of resistance to existing sociotechnical systems that move us today. 


### Objectives

- Students will conduct research (Human-Centered Design methodologies) including interviews, surveys, secondary research, competitive analysis, and usability testing in order to produce an informed and useful app. 

- Students will apply standard usability heuristics to their designs and demonstrate knowledge of these heuristics through giving feedback to other students on the usability heuristic of their designs. 

- Students will compare and contrast Human-Centered Design, Speculative Design, and Critical Design and design critically whether for an experimental artifact or for a practical and realistic one.

- Students will build their apps from the ground up, starting from low fidelity hand-drawn prototypes and ending in a high fidelity digital prototype. 

- Students will use rapid prototyping techniques (iterative design) in order to validate their assumptions, gain insight, and steer their designs towards improvement. 

- Students will familiarize themselves with native UI elements in Apple and Android platforms, explore platform-agnostic UI, and design for one of the platforms of their choice.

- Students will practice presenting and defending their design decisions.

- Students will critique the work of other students and ask constructive questions that will encourage critical thinking about app features and design decisions. 





### Things to bring to class:
:notebook: notebook & :pencil: pencil or :pen: pen



### Tools we will use:
Sketch App, a blog (like Tumblr or a blog of your choice), are.na, and Gmail.



### Projects:
Students will design an app that will fit in one of the following categories: 
1. App as civic engagement tool.
2. Speculative app a design/art project to address potential future societal needs.
3. Critical app design as design/art project that critiques existing social and cultural systems. 
4. Your choice, as long as it follows Human-Centered design guidelines.


### Readings:
Optional: 
[Design and Democracy by Gui iepe](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/desi.2006.22.2.27)
[How Things Don't Work by Victor Papanek](https://papanek.org/how-things-dont-work-the-dreamscape-of-victor-papanek/)

### Assessment and grading
Where applicable, all projects will be evaluated according to the following criteria
in equal weight:

#### Research and ideation: 
Whether and how much thought and investigation have been given toward a particular project in order to arrive at a clear and strong concept.

#### Overall design and concept: 
Formal design quality and how well the piece meets the strategic goals of the project.

#### Organization of content: 
Expression of visual hierarchy, clarity of communication.

#### Execution and craft: 
How well the work meets professional standards, in terms of quality of resolution of images, spelling, and placement of correct native UI elements in the layout. 

The degree of improvement in the quality of a student’s work over the course of the
semester may also be considered in the evaluation of a final grade.
Your final grade will be assessed according to the percentages below:
* Homework assignment completion.............50%
* Quality of work: ..........................15%
* Attendance: ...............................10%
* Participation: ............................10%
* Final: ....................................15%


### General Policies including lateness/absence
Students are expected to arrive in class on time and prepared to work for the entire class
period. Although in-class work sessions are an integral component of this course, outside
work on assignments will be required to meet project deadlines. Significant progress
between classes is expected. Projects are due at the beginning of each class.

Candidates are expected to attend every class session of each course in which they are
enrolled and to be on time. A candidate cannot receive credit for a course if absent more
than two times. No distinction is made between excused and unexcused absences. An
instructor may treat lateness as equivalent to absence. Per CCNY policy, an instructor has
the right to drop a candidate from a course for excessive absences. The Registrar will enter
a grade of WU.

Students who are absent are expected to find out from other students about what they
missed in class as well as any assignments due, and make up the work.
Students who are marked as Absent for more than two classes will have their final grades
reduced by one full letter grade for each additional time they are marked Absent. For
example, and A student who is marked as Absent three times will receive a final grade of B,
one who is marked as Absent four times will receive a final grade of C, and so on.
Students who are more than ten minutes late to class will be marked as Late. Students who
are marked as Late five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction to their final
grades. (For example, a student who would have been given an A as a final grade who is
marked as Late five times will be given a final grade of A-). Students who are marked as Late
more than five times will receive a one-quarter letter-grade reduction for each additional
time they are marked as Late. (For example, that same student would be given a B+ if she
were marked as Late six times, and a B if she were marked as Late seven times). Students
who are marked as Late eight or more times will receive a grade of F for the course.
A break will be designated in each class. Students are asked to refrain from leaving the
classroom at any time other than that designated for the class break, except in cases
of emergency. Students who fail to adhere to this policy repeatedly will be subject to a
reduction in final grade. Students who are more than ten minutes late returning from break
will be marked as Late for the entire class.

Late assignments will be given a one-quarter letter grade reduction for each class they are
late. Missing assignments will be given a grade of F.

Consideration will not be given for failure to produce work due to loss of data. Please back
up your work.

This is a hands-on course, and regular attendance is necessary for participation. You will be graded on in-class participation. If you know you are going to be absent, contact the professor by email in advance. Students who miss numerous classes will find it difficult to pass the course. Visual assignments and projects will be graded based on: one for technical merit, concept and your demonstrated ability to understand the material. 

For the most up-to-date information (including what is due next class) visit the class’s Slack channel (to which you have been invited).

### Academic Integrity
Academic dishonesty is prohibited in Queens College of New York. Penalties for academic
dishonesty include academic sanctions, such as failing or otherwise reduced grades, and/or
disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or expulsion. Cheating is the unauthorized use or
attempted use of material, information, notes, study aids, devices or communication during
an academic exercise. Plagiarism is the act of presenting another person’s ideas, research
or writings as your own. More information is available at http://sps.cuny.edu/acad_policies/
acad_integrity.html
